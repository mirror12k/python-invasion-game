setting of the game:
	alien invasion of earth
		aliens are horrific humanoids piloting ships composed of hard carapace and carrying various colored crystals
			alien technology is based around these crystals giving their ships abilities like teleportation, plasma firing, space compression, and shielding
			aliens have a brutal "raze the land" approach to fighting
			they have no concept of camouflage for unknown reasons, instead placing their defenses in obvious and highly visible locations
		protagonist is a test pilot for an super secret test fighter capable of answering the speed and firepower of the alien ships

graphics:
	basic 8 bit graphics
	shove as many particle effects as the framerate will accept
		particle effects on bullets (bullets spawning, bullets flying, bullets expiring)
		particle effects on destruction of ships (fire, junk, sparks)
		particle effects on bullet impacts against enemies

	mostly static graphics for ships
		a few animations which will be coded seperately for larger ships
		animated particles
	scrolling background
		either tiled or single piece
		it should scroll slowly to allow smaller backgrounds and more parallax effects

mechanics:
	2d top-down shoot-em-up
	player pilots a small ship with 1 health and a very small hitbox
	player has two modes of flight, fast and focused
		fast is the default and provides a wider fire pattern and small homing missiles launched at the nearest enemies
		focused is enabled by holding the shift key and focuses the fire pattern to all forward fire with a havled move speed
			focused does slightly more damage but is limited by it's purely forward firing
	enemies are basic ships with rectagonal collision boxes which can fly in any direction, but primarily down
		they can fire bullets or lasers
			special ships can teleport bullets anywhere they like
			special ships will be designed with sections, requiring sectioned sprites and sectioned collision boxes
		enemies have 4x armor until they become active on the screen
			this is to discourage the player from straight camping the screen edges
		enemies can't fire off-screen
			that would be unfair to players
	should have micro-timeouts to streamline gameplay
		when all enemies are cleared in a wave, the next wave starts immediately
		if the enemies aren't cleared, the next wave starts when the timer timeouts


levels:
	first response against beach landing
		protagonist is sent as a first response to the alien landing force which is gathering troops on the beaches of <>
		protagonist catches the aliens by surprise, able to destroy enemy dropships and troop carriers as they are unloading

		enemies:
			dropships
				equipped with small teleporters and compressed space-time to transport troops and small equipment
				busy offloading troops, they lack firepower but can occasionally fire a single shot
				generic enemies filling up the level

			light fighters
				'W' shaped ships designed for fast attack on enemy light craft

				busy escorting the dropships, they fire in simple bursts
				they fly quickly in groups and fire in various patterns

			gunships
				small crescent shaped ships with a levitating red crystal in the center which they use to fire
				used for close-range support for ground forces

				guarding the landing force, they teleport in and respond by firing large bursts of concentrated fire
				they teleport in groups and act as a serious obstacle for the player

			troop transports
				large bulky ships carrying many spacetime crystals to teleport and transport entire platoons of troops or heavy equipment
				transporting vital forces to the beach, they can drop suppressive energy fields to impede the protagonist
				the player is rewarded greatly in points for destroying ships, but they pose little threat

			light suppression crystals
				small towers built on the beaches to act as AA for the alien forces, fire powerful beam weapons to break up enemy formations
				lone towers present challenges for the player to respond while busy with other enemies

			boss??

	night-time raid on an alien mountain base
		following disastrous military engagements, the protagonist is sent to destroy an identified alien mothership in order to slow alien progress
		the protagonist travels to a dangerous location filled with enemy forces to destroy a local control and operations ship

		enemies:
			light fighters
			medium fighters
				crescent shaped ships, like manta rays
				sent to intercept the player
				higher health than previous fighters and sporting larger firepower
				primary enemies of the level

			corvette
				medium sized ships built of two arched parts levitating around a red central crystal, like a sideways eye
				normally used to annihilate entrenched ground forces, they are weak at fighting agile air targets

				escorting the medium fighters in formations, they can fire large salvos of directed beams as well as suppressive bullets
				the player is rewarded well for destroying these dangerous ships

			light suppression crystals
			heavy suppression crystals
				a medium sized crystal with a few frills circling around it
				large center piece towers designed to defend large local areas, they fire large fields of bullets in all directions and occasional beam bursts
				they appear mostly alone and challenge the player to quickly respond to their massive firepower

			alien heavy control ship (boss)
				large sectioned ring ship rotating around a large yellow crystal
				6 large sections, like flower petals, spin around and carry gun turrets that relentlessly fire at the player
				these sections block damage to the control crystal until they are individually destroyed
				destroying the center crystal destroys the entire control ship
			

	ELO direct assault against alien warp gate
		in a last ditch effort to stop the aliens, command sends all remaining forces in a directed attack at the alien fleet
		protagonist travels with a regiment of friendly ships to attack directly against the alien fleet in orbit with orders to destroy the warp ship that is teleporting the enemy forces to earth

		enemies:
			medium control ship
				similar to the heavy control ship, but smaller
				they command the local forces of the fleet
			alien warp gate (boss)
				a massive sectioned ring ship suspended around a giant blue crystal
				constantly spawns enemy ships to attack the player
