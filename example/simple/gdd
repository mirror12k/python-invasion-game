			aliens have a brutal "raze the land" approach to fighting
			they have no concept of camouflage for unknown reasons, instead placing their defenses in obvious and highly visible locations
		protagonist is a test pilot for an super secret test fighter capable of answering the speed and firepower of the alien ships

				busy offloading troops, they lack firepower but can occasionally fire a single shot
				generic enemies filling up the level

			light fighters
				'W' shaped ships designed for fast attack on enemy light craft

				busy escorting the dropships, they fire in simple bursts
				they fly quickly in groups and fire in various patterns

			gunships
				small crescent shaped ships with a levitating red crystal in the center which they use to fire
				used for close-range support for ground forces

				guarding the landing force, they teleport in and respond by firing large bursts of concentrated fire
				they teleport in groups and act as a serious obstacle for the player

			troop transports
				large bulky ships carrying many spacetime crystals to teleport and transport entire platoons of troops or heavy equipment
				transporting vital forces to the beach, they can drop suppressive energy fields to impede the protagonist
				the player is rewarded greatly in points for destroying ships, but they pose little threat

			light suppression crystals
				small towers built on the beaches to act as AA for the alien forces, fire powerful beam weapons to break up enemy formations
				lone towers present challenges for the player to respond while busy with other enemies
